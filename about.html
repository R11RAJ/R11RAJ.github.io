        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Raj Prajapati (So easy to guess right!!),I am a Computer science student currently pursuing Master of Technology program in Machine Learning from <a href="https://www.daiict.ac.in/"><u>Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar</u></a>.
            I love coding and figuring out solutions for complex problems.
            I have completed my high school from Kendriya Vidyalaya Silvassa and bachelors in engineering from Parul University Vadodara
            in Computer Science and Engineering with a CPI of 9.02 out of 10.<br><br>
            I have been into this field since my 11th grade i.e.from 2014. I am a quick learner and always want to explore new programming languages and frameworks.
            I was an Erasmus student in 2017 and went to Wroclaw University of Science and Technology for a fully funded semester exchange program known as Erasmus+ Program.
            So far I have travelled across 9 countries in Europe and visited a lot of famous places like Eiffel tower,Camp Nou Stadium in barcelona,Atomium centre brussels etc.Yes I am a traveller and adventure lover.<br><br>

            Currently I am doing research for my Masters program and also work as a Teaching Assistant @DAIICT Gandhinagar. <br>Want to see my resume?<a href="assets/CV.pdf" target="_blank"><u> here's a link to it </u></a>.
